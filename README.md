# Localy – Digitizing South Africa’s Informal Economy

Localy is a community-driven C2C (consumer-to-consumer) e-commerce platform built to connect South Africa’s informal sellers — like spaza shops, street vendors, and hawkers, with nearby customers through an easy-to-use online marketplace.

It is designed for people who usually trade offline, helping them advertise their products online, reach more customers, and take part in digital trade without needing technical knowledge or large fees. For customers, Localy offers a simple way to browse affordable, local goods from sellers in their area.
